# Project Compilation Guide

This project consists of multiple C++ programs that can be compiled using a `Makefile`.

## Compilation
To compile all the executables, run:
```sh
make
```
This will generate the following executables:
- `exo1.exe`
- `exo2.exe`
- `exo3.exe`
- `exo4.exe`
- `exo5.exe`

You can also compile a specific executable by running:
```sh
make exo1
```
Replace `exo1` with the name of the executable you want to compile.

## Running the Executables
After compilation, you can run an executable with:
```sh
./exo1.exe
```
Replace `exo1.exe` with the name of the executable you want to run.

## Cleaning Up
To remove all compiled executables, run:
```sh
make clean
```
